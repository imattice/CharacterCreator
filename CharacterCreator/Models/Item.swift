//Option 1: Mark ItemRecord as final; add ItemRecord properties to all subclasses
//Option 2: Prevent ItemRecord from conforming to Record; find another way to get Record confirmance, such as duplicating Record protocol code, which would be bad form
//Option 3: Ignore the problem for now, since the ideal data flow will not be to call Records from JSON and instead from a data store like Core Data
